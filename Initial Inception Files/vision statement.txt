Vision Statement 1.0
________________________________________________________________

For people who want to know great Northwest Oregon Hiking 
destinations and their proximity.  Our hiking application is 
an application that makes it easy to see not only how close, 
but what type of hike it is based of difficulty and description 
for instance.  This application gives anyone with an Android 
device the ability to quickly and easily find local hikes to 
try either solo or with friends. The play store currently does 
not fill this very well, that is where this application takes 
over.  Northwest Oregon Hiking will have an intuitive and simple 
design to make it a better experience for the end user.
